Before running the scripts, install the required dependencies using pip as shown below:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once the dependencies are installed, rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the required API keys in the file.

Then, you can try running one of the scripts with python as follows:

```sh
python 02_Simple_Q\&A_Gemini/app_gemini.py 
```

Starting from Chapter 5, use streamlit to run the application:

```sh
streamlit run 05_Adding_Streamlit_GUI/app_gpt.py
```

For how these applications work and more, you can get the book at https://mybook.to/lc-py
